Facebook-Scripts
================

##Overview
Python scripts to experiment with Facebook graph search.
We use Graph API provided by Facebook for the same. To use the Graph API, it is necessary for the user to generate an Access Token. 
* * *
Steps to use the Access Token in the script:

1) Go to [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)

2) Login with your regular Facebook ID.

3) In the Access Token Edit Box, you might see some existing token already. Press "x" near the Edit Box to clear the Access Token.

4) Now select "Get Access Token" to get a new Access Token.

5) Select the appropriate permissions.

6) Click "Get Access Token".

7) In The Access Token Edit Box, you will now see the Access Token generated with new permissions.

###Objective
To make a script which can be used to do most of the facebook actions using graph API.

Few operations which can be planned to do from this script are like Multiple group post, 
Downloading Profile pics of friends etc.

Operations what are to be implemented will be put up in [Todo](https://github.com/sant0sh/Facebook-Scripts/blob/master/Todo.md)
